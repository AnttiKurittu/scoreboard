# scoreboard
The scoreboard script used in the NCSC-FI #tietoturvahaaste-hackathon.

Requires PHP. Copy the files and folders to the directory that serves your webpages. Open in browser and F11 for full screen.

The folder '''teams/''' holds the teams and scoring. Create a text file for each team. See example files for syntax, '''index.php''' source for configuration instructions.
